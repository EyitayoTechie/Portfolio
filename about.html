<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Eyitayo Salami. I am from Nigeria but live in UK now. I Currently work as a 
  Fraud Analyst with Barclays Bank. I absolutely adore my job, however, just like everyone
   else, the pandemic had an impact on me. I know what you are thinking   :) yes, I still 
   use my airfryer till date; but not just that, I learnt HTML and CSS in the comfort of my
   room and built two websites. I moved on to learning JavaScript, but the pandemic was 
   over and I went back to school for my masters degree and got my job after, but the seed
   of programming has been sown and three years down the line I am back here putting in 
   hours daily to fine tune my craft and perfect my skill. I aim to build mobile applications,
    web applications among other things.

<p>On a personal note, my favourite colour is green.</p>
