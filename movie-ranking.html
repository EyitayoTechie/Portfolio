<h1>The Best Movies according to Eyitayo</h1>    
<h2> My top three movies of all times!</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p> This movie taught me that if the human mind is set to do a thing, it can achieve it</p>
<h3>Sound of music</h3>
<p>A rather old movie, but the movie is just generally happy.</p><br /> N.B I almost contemplated starting a music career.
<h3>Koto Aiye</h3>
<p> A yoruba movie, but I learnt that you could suffer from something that is not 
    <br /> caused by you, however, you can change the trajetory of things by just being proactive</p>
